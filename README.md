# Test-Drive-Plan

For this third test drive, we plan to manually steer the rover for a trajectory that aims to maximize exploration of the territory (while we get to the indicated waypoints). We will do this because additionally, we will be running a program that allows us to extract images and other data, this information will be very important to test and develop our computer vision algorithms (using image processing and deep learning). We would do the necessary tests with our developed algorithms later (with our own rover) to be ready to compete in the ERC 2021.
