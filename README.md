# Test-Drive-Plan

For this 3rd test drive, we plan to drive the rover manually so that a trajectory is made that aims to maximize the territory's exploration. We will do this because additionally, we will be running a program that allows us to extract images and other data, this information will be very important to test and develop our computer vision algorithms (using image processing and deep learning). We would do the necessary tests with our developed algorithms to be ready for competition with our own rover.
